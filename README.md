## Dynamic Routing Overview
Dynamic routing is an approach in web development that allows for dynamically configuring routes through backend models and controllers. This reduces the need for duplicating route files and simplifies code maintenance.

## Advantages
- **Simple and Beginner-Friendly:** Dynamic routing simplifies route management and is suitable for beginners in web development.
- **Organized:** Reduces code redundancy by managing routes centrally.

## Disadvantages
- **Security:** Requires thorough testing for security vulnerabilities due to dynamic configuration.
- **Increased Server Load:** Large numbers of forms can potentially burden the server with increased data transmission, especially during form creation.
- **Consider Using Filament:** If available, consider using Filament instead of building from scratch.

## Recommendations
To implement dynamic routing effectively, configure backend models and controllers according to your application's needs.
